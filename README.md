# Credit-Score-Prediction-Using-ML
This project leverages machine learning to predict credit scores based on financial data, helping users assess creditworthiness effectively. By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple ML models, we determine the best algorithm for accurate credit score prediction
Project Workflow
- Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Structured dataset creation.
- Cleaned and normalized financial data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Applied Visual Data Analysis (VDA) for insights.
- Generated graphs showcasing credit score trends.
- Model Selection & Training
- Implemented three ML models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Evaluated performance & optimized models.
- Found Random Forest to be the best-performing model.
Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
